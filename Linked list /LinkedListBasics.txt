1. we never disturb the head pointer , instead use a temp pointer to traverse the linked list 
2. pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable 
2.1. pointer variable is stored in stack memory ie address of nodes are stored in stack memory 
3. for linked list we use node data structure 
4. class node{
    public:
    int data;
    node* next; // pointer variable that stores the address of next node 
} this is self referential structure of class
5. struct vs class - by default struct has all members public , class has all members private by default
6. we have declared the blueprint of linked list node structure now we want to create nodes and store values in it 
7. create an instance of node object / creating node 
8. node object /instances is created in heap 
9. creating node syntax- node* n1=new node 
10. n->data =10;
11. n->next=NULL;
